## 📘 Project Overview

This project implements the ID3 algorithm to learn decision trees from datasets of varying characteristics.
It handles categorical and numerical attributes, performs k-fold and leave-one-out cross-validation, and calculates balanced accuracy to ensure fair evaluation for imbalanced datasets.

The project also demonstrates using decision trees to inform AI strategies in a Connect 4 game, replacing the utility function from previous assignments with tree-based predictions.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement the ID3 algorithm to build decision trees from any CSV dataset.
- Handle datasets with categorical and numerical attributes.
- Apply the trained tree to new test examples for prediction.
- Evaluate models using balanced accuracy and cross-validation techniques.
- Integrate the decision tree predictions into Connect 4 gameplay for AI decision-making.

## 🗂 Dataset
- restaurant — a classic categorical dataset.
- weather — weather conditions for decision-making examples.
- iris — the well-known iris classification dataset.
- connect4 challenge dataset — each line represents a board configuration, used to train a tree for AI gameplay.
